### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- HTML, CSS , JS 

- What I have learnt
  - Took a new approach to handling the navigation switching the material icon span innerhtml to get the nav to show up
  - Also used two media queries for the nav links to act as they shoul leaving the same x-tics on the boiler css 

-Code :- 
```css
@media screen and (width < 500px) {
  header nav .navs {
    display: none;
    place-content: center;
    flex-direction: column;
    z-index: 10;
    position: absolute;
    inset: 0 0 0 0;
    background-color: var(--black);
    transition: all 300ms ease-in;
  }

  .hamburger {
    z-index: 1000;
  }
}
@media screen and (width > 500px) {
  .hamburger {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

```js
hamburgerBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  // Change hamburger menue to close
  hamburgerBtn.innerHTML === "menu"
    ? (hamburgerBtn.innerHTML = "close")
    : (hamburgerBtn.innerHTML = "menu");

  // Show navigation links

  hamburgerBtn.innerHTML === "close"
    ? (navs.style.display = "flex")
    : (navs.style.display = "none");
});

```
